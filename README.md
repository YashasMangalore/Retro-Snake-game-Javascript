# Snake Game

## Overview
The aim of the Snake game is to collect as many food items as possible, which makes the snake longer. The game ends if the snake hits itself.

## Setting Up the Game Environment
We'll create the HTML and CSS structure that serves as the game board.

---

## Creating the Snake
We'll create our snake using JavaScript and style it using CSS.

---

## Movement of the Snake
We'll set up the snake's movement and its control with arrow keys.

---

## Food for the Snake
We'll create the food that the snake will consume to grow larger.

---

## Score System
We'll track the player's score and high score, displaying them on the screen.

---

## Edge Wrapping
We'll make the game screen "wrap around", meaning if the snake moves off the edge of the screen, it will appear on the opposite side.

---

## Game Over Condition
We'll implement the game ending condition when the snake collides with itself.
