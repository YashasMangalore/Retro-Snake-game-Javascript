# Snake Game

## Overview
The aim of the Snake game is to collect as many food items as possible, which makes the snake longer. The game ends if the snake hits itself.

Here's the breakdown of how we're going to approach this:

1. **Setting Up the Game Environment:** We'll create the HTML and CSS structure that serves as the game board.
2. **Creating the Snake:** We'll create our snake using JavaScript, and style it using CSS.
3. **Movement of the Snake:** We'll set up the snake's movement and its control with arrow keys.
4. **Food for the Snake:** We'll create the food that the snake will consume to grow larger.
5. **Score System:** We'll track the player's score and high score, displaying them on the screen.
6. **Edge Wrapping:** We'll make the game screen "wrap around", meaning if the snake moves off the edge of the screen, it will appear on the opposite side.
7. **Game Over Condition:** We'll implement the game ending condition when the snake collides with itself.
